# autotorio

Factorio stuff.

Several parts :

* [fbp-rs](https://github.com/deciduously/fbp-rs)  - Blueprint string library - TODO stablilize as a library
* calculator - getting required components for desired output.  Give it a rate and an output target and it gives you a full list of resources used at that same rate and every factorty component you will need to attain the pipeline
* Blueprint generator - Will have basic building blocks and logic for stringing them together with belt connections, returning new blueprints.  Only planned.

# Crates

* [`lazy_static`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs)
